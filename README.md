## ansible example exercise files

To Practice with these files, you need 5 host 
named as the following 


1) workstation.lab.example.com
2) servera.lab.example.com
3) serverb.lab.example.com
4) serverc.lab.example.com
5) serverd.lab.example.com

                                                  
You can use /etc/hosts in each machine to name them ( need not to have DNS ) 
then, you can install ansible 2.X on workstation machine and pull this repo and practice
