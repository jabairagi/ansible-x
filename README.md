# ansible-x
ansible example exercise files

To Practice with these files, you need 5 Host *  EL [7|8] 
named as the following 


workstation.lab.example.com
servera.lab.example.com
serverb.lab.example.com
serverc.lab.example.com
serverd.lab.example.com

                                                  
You can use /etc/hosts in each machine to name them ( need not to have DNS ) 
then, you can install ansible 2.X on workstation machine and pull this repo and practice
